Additional online readings will also be assigned over the course of the semester. 


### Evaluation and Grading ###

Course grades will be based on a combination of participation in live and online discussions and peer-review, the smaller assignments (listed under the "Assignment" column in the class calendar), and the semester-long class project. The grade for the class will be weighted according to the following breakdown:

* Class Participation: 20%
* Small Assignments: 40%
* Class Project: 40%


### Class Topics ###

Over the course of the semester we will address the following topics:

* The interaction between the *research* and *data* lifecycles
* Types of spatial data - *vector*, *raster* and *geodatabase* data models
* Database design concepts, including aspects of database design specifically related to geospatially enabled databases
* Data format considerations for long-term archival access and use
* Documenting your data products - metadata content and standards
* Data management planning, both in support of your research and also to meet funding agency requirements
* Ethical, legal and privacy issues as they relate to the data you both generate and use

### Tools ###

* Recent Windows, Mac or Linux Operating System
* GIS - Quantum GIS [http://www.qgis.org/](http://www.qgis.org/)
* Spatial Database - SpatiaLite
	* [http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks)[Mac OS X]
	* [http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/](http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/)[Windows & Source (Linux)]
* Python (possible, based upon interest)



### Communication ###

This is the first iteration of this class, so the most productive communication model will evolve over the semester, but I commit to the following:

* I will respond to email questions within ~24 hours

* I will share responses to common questions with the rest of the class through the online discussion board

I also *strongly* encourage that questions be submitted through the discussion board so that other students can both *learn from* and *contribute to* the answers provided.
