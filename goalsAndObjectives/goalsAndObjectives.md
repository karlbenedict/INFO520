# Introduction

An understanding of core spatial data concepts and principles is increasingly important in the current world of collaborative, spatially enabled research and applications. We are no longer working in a vacuum as individual researchers that only need to understand and use the data that we create and use in our separate research projects. Successful research depends upon being able to integrate data generated by others with our own and by extension being able to share our data with others, both during our research projects and also for posterity (and to meet the requirements of funding agencies). This class will focus on the following aspects of spatial data management that relate to this need for effective integration, use, collaboration and sharing:

* The _Research_ and _Data Lifecycles_
* Types of spatial data
* Spatial database design and management
* Working with and managing gridded data
* Spatial data documentation standards and practices
* Data management planning 
* Ethical, legal and privacy issues as they relate to spatial data
* Emerging topics

Upon completion of the course students will have improved their knowledge and skills in the following areas:

* Locating and evaluating spatial data based upon knowledge of formats, content models and documentation standards
* Structuring data (both in terms of format selection and content) from a variety of sources to enable integrated research 
* Evaluate data products to determine which elements of a dataset might raise ethical, legal or privacy issues if released or shared with others
* Documenting data as an ongoing process throughout the research cycle
* Producing machine- and human-readable documentation for data to support discovery, understanding, and use of data that they produce




# Week 1 - Introductions, Course Overview and Introduction to the Research and Data Lifecycles #

This week's required "collaboratory" session will allow us to share some background about each other, review the class structure and objectives and have a brief overview of the research and data lifecycles and the linkages beween them.

# Week 2 - Introduction to Vector Data #

## Background ##

This week we begin our consideration of the different classes of geospatial data that you are likely to encounter - both as you search for data to use in your research and as you produce data with a spatial component that you need to integrate into a spatial data management system or workflow. Our focus is on *vector* datasets this week, with a particular emphasis on the general types of vector data *features* you need to be aware of, and the key linkage between vector *geometries* and the *attributes* that are linked to those features. While the introductory lecture focuses on these aspects of vector datasets, the concepts of *map projections* or *coordinate reference systems* as introduced in the reading are also core concepts that you will need to understand in the context of all spatial data that you work with. Next week's lecture will include a more detailed overview of map projections (and focus on raster data), but for now see what you can also pick up from the reading as it blends both vector and raster data and map projections into a single chapter. 

## Expected Outcomes ##

By the end of this week's reading and work you should have an understanding of:

* The types of geometries that are likely to be encountered when working with vector data
* The concept of attributes and attribute types as they are linked to features
* The beginning of an understanding of how you can transform tabular data that may have implicit spatial content into explicitly spatial data 
* The importance of map projections in clearly understanding the spatial context for coordinates and geometries based upon those coordinates. 

## Key Concepts ##

* Vector Feature Types: *point*, *line*, *polygon*
* Attributes and associated attribute data types
* Map projections

# Week 6 - Geodatabase Design #

## Background ##

This week we introduce the concepts related to the integration of geospatial data into relational database systems. This integration includes both the introduction of new data types into the database (i.e. the `geometry` data type), specialized indices that are optimized for working with those data, and additional functions that extend the SQL foundation of these databases to support additional query types that are explicitly spatial. 

## Expected Outcomes and Key Concepts ##

At the end of this section of the course, you should understand the following:

* The model for expanding standard relational databases to include support for geometries and their associated attributes
* The range of specialized spatial queries that can be used within a geospatially enabled database

# Week 7 - Managing Raster Data #

## Background ##

Much of our focus thus far has been on database development, and concepts related to the management of data that link most directly into the vector data model - geometries and their associated attributes. This week we will concentrate on the characteristics of raster data, and highlight some tools and strategies for creating and managing raster data products. 

## Expected Outcomes and Key Concepts ##

Following this week's work you should understand the following:

* The circumstances in which you might use a raster as opposed to vector data model for you data
* The concept of spatial resolution as it relates to raster data
* Some of the processing and analysis functions that may be applied to raster data
* The basic functionality of the GDAL utilities for characterizing and transforming raster datasets. 

## Reading ##

"Raster" in the [Encyclopedia of Geographic Information Science](http://libproxy.unm.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=e000xna&AN=474337&site=eds-live&scope=site&ebv=EB&ppid=pp_361)

Revisit the Quantum GIS User Guide - particularly the section on [Raster Data](http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/index.html). 

Review the documentation for the [GDAL Utilities](http://www.gdal.org/gdal_utilities.html), particularly 

* [`gdalinfo`](http://www.gdal.org/gdalinfo.html)
* [`gdal_translate`](http://www.gdal.org/gdal_translate.html)
* [`gdalwarp`](http://www.gdal.org/gdalwarp.html)

as these utilities based upon the GDAL library for processing Raster datasets provide very useful tools for interrogating and transforming raster data. For complementary capabilities for vector datasets, review the documentation for the OGR-related utilities:

* [`ogrinfo`](http://www.gdal.org/ogrinfo.html)
* [`ogr2ogr`](http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html)

All of these GDAL and OGR utilities are included as part of the installation process of QGIS on your computer, and are accessible through the OSGEO4W shell in Windows, or from the terminal under the Mac OS.

# Week 8 - Data Formats for Analysis and Archiving #

## Background ##

Thus far we have concentrated on data formats in general as they relate to the storage and use of different types of geospatial data. This week, we consider a set of issues that relate to the long-term archival storage, access and use of geospatial data. Specifically, this week's reading and discussion in this week's collaboratory focus on the diversity of geospatial data formats, with a particular emphasis on the characteristics of those formats that make them good (or not good) candidates for use when transitioning geospatial data into a long-term archive. 

## Expected Outcomes and Key Concepts ##

Following this week's work you should understand the following:

* The factors that influence the utility of various digital geospatial formats for archival use
* The particular characteristics of digital geospatial formats that relate to their usability in geospatial analysis and visualization work
* The capabilities of key digital geospatial formats relative to these factors and characteristics

# Week 9 - Documenting Data - The Interview #

## Background ##

When approaching the problem of documenting data during analysis, for sharing with collaborators, and for long-term sharing and access through an archive, multiple dimensions of information and structure must be considered. The readings introduced this week (and continuing for the next several weeks) cover the diverse issues, challenges and initiatives related to metadata creation and data curation. Whether you are working with others in support of metadata creation, or are creating you own metadata, the process of metadata development can be conceptualized in terms of an interview - with you playing either the role of the interviewer or interviewee. In the context of the metadata development interview, the following questions should be asked and answered:

* Data content and structure
	* What do the data represent (measurements/observations)
	* How are they structured (i.e. format)
	* What are the accuracy and precision of the data
* Context
	* Where, when and how were the data collected
	* What processing steps were followed in the production of the data
	* Who was responsible for data collection and how may they be contacted 
	* What is the research domain for which the data were collected
	* For what purpose were the data collected/produced
	* Are the data part of a larger collection (e.g. an ongoing series of measurements or a set of otherwise related data products)
* Related Standards, Practices and  Resources
	* Are there existing archives that specialize in the preservation of the data
	* Are there existing documentation standards that are commonly used by those archives or the research domain to which the data pertain
	* What data citation standards are practiced within the specific research domain - what information is required to support those data citation standards
	* How do the data products align with the norms, protocols or standards for integration into the target archive(s)

# Week 10 - XML Document Creation, editing and validation #

## Background ##

The World Wide Web Consortium's ([W3C](http://www.w3.org/)) specification of the `Extensible Markup Language` ([XML](http://www.w3.org/standards/xml/)) has become the common standard format for many documentation (metadata) standards. As a machine readable (and validatable) data format that is also *somewhat* human-readable, XML is a core technology in the exchange of structured data in a platform-independent, standards-based format. The XML standard defines both core *structural* requirements that any XML file must meet to be considered *well-formed* XML, and provides for extensibility and validation using either *document type definition* or *schema* definitions. This extensibility allows for the definition of application-specific XML data content models that may be validated both in terms of structure and content, using a variety of XML *validation* technologies. Before embarking on the creation of XML-based spatial metadata over the next two weeks, we must first become familiar with the basics of the XML specification - that is the goal of this week's work. 

## Expected Outcomes and Key Concepts ##

Following this week's work you should understand the following

* XML is a standard upon which structured data may be exchanged between computer systems
* XML may be created using any standard text editor, but specialized editors make this process easier
* XML may (and should) be validated, both for consistency with the XML structural requirements (well-formed) and with any defined content specification (valid as defined by a DTD or Schema)

## Note on Software ##

This week you may want to consider downloading an XML editor (such as [Aptana Studio](http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3.html) as used in the Lynda.com tutorial, or [Oxygen](http://www.oxygenxml.com/) as an alternative to creating your XML documents in a standard OS-provided text editor such as `notepad` (Windows) or a freely downloadable text editor such as `notepad++` ([download link](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows) or `textwrangler` ([download link](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) for Mac).  



# Week 11 - Metadata Standards - FGDC #

## Background ##

Following our introduction to general metadata concepts and principles two weeks ago, and the overview of XML technologies last week, we are now ready to begin our consideration of specific metadata standards that are relevant to the documentation of geospatial data products. This week we focus on the Federal Geospatial Data Committee's *Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata* (CSDGM), the continuing but aging US Federal geospatial metadata standard. While it is slowly being replaced by the ISO 19115-2 and related standards (our focus for next week), there remain a large number of FGDC metadata records and tools "in the wild", and because of this remains very relevant when considering metadata standards related to geospatial data. 

## Expected Outcomes and Key Concepts ##

Following this week's work students should understand the following:

* The basic structural and content model for FGDC metadata

When creating FGDC metadata your can use an [online validation tool](http://geo-nsdi.er.usgs.gov/validation/) as a complement to local validation with your XML tool of choice. 




# Week 12 - Metadata Standards - ISO and Dublin Core #

## Background ##

The FGDC's CSDGM was an early structured metadata standard from which lessons have been learned, contributing to the thinking that has gone into the development of the family of geospatial metadata standards developed by the International Standards Organization's Technical Committee 211. Of specific relevance in the context of our work here are the ISO 19115, ISO 19115-2 and ISO 19139 standards for documenting geospatial data. While the actual standards must be purchased from ISO, a large amount of documentation has been developed by a number of organizations - particularly the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (a number of their resources are included in this week's reading). While a large number of FGDC metadata records exist as legacy products from many geospatial organizations, new metadata creation is probably best done in the context of the ISO standards as they provide a more structured and complete model for capturing more detailed information if it is available. 

In contrast with the FGDC and ISO metadata standards that we have already discussed, Dublin Core is a more general documentation standard that is widely used in the library community and beyond. Dublin Core is a documentation standard that is based, in contrast to the XML-based FGDC and ISO standards, on the W3C's Resource Description Framework ([RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/)), the foundation for the emerging open linked data model for data integration across the web. RDF is explicitly built upon the construction of linkages between semantically linked information pieces that are defined in a way that allows for their reuse and integration, by reference, into knowledge about other resources (i.e. datasets, measurement types, units, people, objects, publications, etc.). While the FGDC and ISO standards include robust specifications for defining spatial references, Dublin Core's `coverage` property provides for only very basic geospatial reference information. 

## Expected Outcomes and Key Concepts ##

Following this week's work, the following concepts should be understood:

* The relationship between the FGDC and ISO geospatial metadata standards for documenting geospatial data
* The basic strategies for developing ISO metadata and the overall structural and content model for ISO metadata
* The distinction between the XML and RDF structural models for metadata
* The high-level content types for Dublin Core metadata

The [Dublin Core Users Guide](http://wiki.dublincore.org/index.php/User_Guide) describes the basic concepts behind the Dublin Core standard, its use of the W3C RDF Open Linked data model, and its role in the broader global system of metadata. Of specific interest in the context of geospatial metadata in the Dublin Core standard is the [coverage](http://tinyurl.com/pubjloq) property. 

## Assignment ##

Create a data management plan (start)

## Notes on Software ##

ArcGIS ArcCatalog includes a basic editor for creating ISO metadata that can then be brought into a dedicated XML editor for completion or further editing. Information about the ISO standards and ESRI's support for them is available [here](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#//003t00000039000000). 

Quantum GIS also has an experimental plugin called [metatools](http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/metatools/) that supports the import, viewing and editing of FGDC and ISO metadata. As an experimental plugin your mileage may vary. 
 
The *Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative* has developed an online [web-based ISO 19115-2 editor](https://data.gulfresearchinitiative.org/metadata-editor/) that can be used to create a based metadata record that you might want to further augment with more detailed information. 

## Required Collaboratory Session ##

Data management planning Q&A








# Week 13 - Data Management Planning #

## Background ##

While there is a significant focus on *Data Management Plans* as a component of project proposals, *data management planning* is a fundamental activity that all researchers should engage in, regardless of what artifacts of the process may be demanded by sponsors. Data management planning is the conscious process of examining the data that are going to be used and generated by a project; the processes that will executed in the acquisition, generation and analysis of those data; the documentation that will be accumulated for those data; the policies for access, sharing and reuse of the data beyond the current project; the technical procedures for ensuring the security of the data both during and after the project; and any legal or ethical issues that must be considered when planning for the management and long-term archival access to project-related data. Having considered all of these topics, the development of a data management plan in the specific form required by a funding agency can be a fairly straightforward process.  


## Expected Outcomes and Key Concepts ##

After completing this week's work, students should have a good understanding of the following:

* The distinction between *data management planning* as a process and a *data management plan* as a specific artifact of that process
* The key roles of data, documentation, legal and technical issues in a holistic view of data management throughout the data lifecycle.

# Week 16 - Ethical, legal and privacy issues / Emerging Concepts #

## Background ##

Over the course of the semester we have focused on the technical aspects of spatial data management - data structures, documentation standards and tools, and formats. While this technical foundation is necessary for the effective management of spatial data, there are other factors that influence you decisions about whether or how you are able to reuse data generated by other researchers, how you share your data, and what data you should share and what data should be left undistributed. These questions lead us into a discussion of the ethical and legal issues related to privacy and copyright. This week's materials provide an introduction to some of these issues as an overview of some of the things you should be thinking about as you generate your own data products and make use of the products of others. 

## Expected Outcomes and Key Concepts ##

At the end of this class you should have a basic understanding of some of the key issues related to:

* ethical and privacy concerns as they relate to the creation, management and sharing of data with a spatial component
* copyright and licensing options and issues related to scientific data, including spatial data
