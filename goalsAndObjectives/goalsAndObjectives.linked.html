<p>An understanding of core spatial data concepts and principles is increasingly important in the current world of collaborative, spatially enabled research and applications. We are no longer working in a vacuum as individual researchers that only need to understand and use the data that we create and use in our separate research projects. Successful research depends upon being able to integrate data generated by others with our own and by extension being able to share our data with others, both during our research projects and also for posterity (and to meet the requirements of funding agencies). This class will focus on the following aspects of spatial data management that relate to this need for effective integration, use, collaboration and sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Research</em> and <em>Data Lifecycles</em></li>
<li>Types of spatial data</li>
<li>Spatial database design and management</li>
<li>Working with and managing gridded data</li>
<li>Spatial data documentation standards and practices</li>
<li>Ethical, legal and privacy issues as they relate to spatial data</li>
<li>Data management planning</li>
<li>Emerging topics</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon completion of the course students will have improved their knowledge and skills in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locating and evaluating spatial data based upon knowledge of formats, content models and documentation standards</li>
<li>Structuring data (both in terms of format selection and content) from a variety of sources to enable integrated research</li>
<li>Evaluate data products to determine which elements of a dataset might raise ethical, legal or privacy issues if released or shared with others</li>
<li>Documenting data as an ongoing process throughout the research cycle</li>
<li>Producing machine- and human-readable documentation for data to support discovery, understanding, and use of data that they produce</li>
</ul>

<p>This week's required &quot;collaboratory&quot; session (Tuesday afternoon, 5:00-6:30 - method TBA) will allow us to share some background about each other, review the class structure and objectives and have a brief overview of the research and data lifecycles and the linkages beween them. While this week's lecture will be done &quot;live&quot; during our collaboratory session, future lectures will be pre-recorded and accessible at the beginning of each class week.</p>

<h3 id="background"><a href="#background">Background</a></h3>
<p>This week we begin our consideration of the different classes of geospatial data that you are likely to encounter - both as you search for data to use in your research and as you produce data with a spatial component that you need to integrate into a spatial data management system or workflow. Our focus is on <em>vector</em> datasets this week, with a particular emphasis on the general types of vector data <em>features</em> you need to be aware of, and the key linkage between vector <em>geometries</em> and the <em>attributes</em> that are linked to those features. While the introductory lecture focuses on these aspects of vector datasets, the concepts of <em>map projections</em> or <em>coordinate reference systems</em> as introduced in the reading are also core concepts that you will need to understand in the context of all spatial data that you work with. Next week's lecture will include a more detailed overview of map projections (and focus on raster data), but for now see what you can also pick up from the reading as it blends both vector and raster data and map projections into a single chapter.</p>
<h3 id="expected-outcomes"><a href="#expected-outcomes">Expected Outcomes</a></h3>
<p>By the end of this week's reading and work you should have an understanding of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The types of geometries that are likely to be encountered when working with vector data</li>
<li>The concept of attributes and attribute types as they are linked to features</li>
<li>The beginning of an understanding of how you can transform tabular data that may have implicit spatial content into explicitly spatial data</li>
<li>The importance of map projections in clearly understanding the spatial context for coordinates and geometries based upon those coordinates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-concepts"><a href="#key-concepts">Key Concepts</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Vector Feature Types: <em>point</em>, <em>line</em>, <em>polygon</em></li>
<li>Attributes and associated attribute data types</li>
<li>Map projections</li>
</ul>
