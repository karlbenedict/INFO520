<h2 id="week-2---domain-specific-literature-review"><a href="#week-2---domain-specific-literature-review">Week 2 - Domain-Specific Literature Review</a></h2>
<p><em>Please post results of literature review to the the Learn Discussion area prior to the 2/11 Tuesday Collaboratory session</em></p>
<p>Please find at least 4 peer-reviewed publications that identify and discuss spatial data management issues in your field of study. For each of the publications provide a 1-page writeup that includes the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Complete Citation</dt>
<dd><p>A complete citation that would allow another researcher to locate the publication that you used. If available, provide the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) and online link for the publication.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Summary</dt>
<dd><p>A brief summary of the publication's focus and conclusions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Relevance</dt>
<dd><p>A discussion of the relevance of the publication's findings to your interest in spatial data management in your research area/project.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You will be asked to provide a brief (10 minute) summary of what you found as a result of your literature review during the required 2/11 collaboratory session.</p>
<h2 id="week-2---class-project---define-your-data-management-focus-for-the-term"><a href="#week-2---class-project---define-your-data-management-focus-for-the-term">Week 2 - Class Project - Define your data management focus for the term</a></h2>
<p>Please develop a 2-paragraph summary description of your spatial data management focus for your class project. This focus will define the data products that you will create and document over the course of the semester. Ideally, these will be data that you are using in your research. If you are having a difficult identifying a topic area please contact Dr. Benedict to discuss the possibilities.</p>
<p>Provide this summary description to Dr. Benedict by <em>February 10</em> and set up an appointment with Dr. Benedict to review your plan.</p>
<h2 id="week-5---locate-and-describe-data-and-review"><a href="#week-5---locate-and-describe-data-and-review">Week 5 - Locate and Describe Data and Review</a></h2>
<p><em>Please post results of your data review to the the Learn Discussion area prior to the 3/11 Tuesday Collaboratory session</em></p>
<p>Find and review three datasets that are of interest to you and/or relevant to your research. For each of the three datasets provide a 1-page evaluation that addresses the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Summary</dt>
<dd><p>A summary description of the dataset, it's content and structure/format.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Documentation</dt>
<dd><p>The completeness of the available documentation that is available for the dataset - particularly focusing on the information that the documentation provides that contributes to the dataset's <em>usability</em> and <em>understanding</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Usability</dt>
<dd><p>How usable is the dataset to you? Can you make sense of it? Is it in a format that you can use?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Relevance</dt>
<dd><p>The relevance of the dataset in the context of your research interests/study domain.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You will be asked to provide a brief (10 minute) summary of what you found as a result of your data review during the required 3/11 collaboratory session.</p>

<p>Document three datasets that you plan on creating and documenting for your class project. Include the following in your descriptions of the datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Type (raster, vector)</li>
<li>Format (data format)</li>
<li>Content (what types of data values will you include in the dataset)</li>
<li>Purpose - what is your intended purpose for the data</li>
<li>Map projection and units</li>

<p>Over the next two weeks create your initial data products - they can be expanded and updated after initial creation, but you need to have done enough work on them to begin the documentation process in Week 12.</p>
<h2 id="week-12---class-project---begin-creating-your-documentation-for-your-data-products"><a href="#week-12---class-project---begin-creating-your-documentation-for-your-data-products">Week 12 - Class Project - Begin creating your documentation for your data products</a></h2>
<p>Work on both completing your data products and their related documentation prior to our data and documentation peer review activity in Week 15.</p>
<h2 id="week-13---create-a-data-management-plan"><a href="#week-13---create-a-data-management-plan">Week 13 - Create a Data Management Plan</a></h2>
<p><em>Please post your data management plan to the discussion area prior to 4/28 to facilitate peer-review</em></p>
<p>Produce a 2-page NSF Data Management Plan appropriate for the particular NSF program within which your research domain would operate.</p>
