Summary
:	A brief summary of the publication's focus and conclusions.

Relevance
:	A discussion of the relevance of the publication's findings to your interest in spatial data management in your research area/project. 

You will be asked to provide a brief (10 minute) summary of what you found as a result of your literature review during the required 2/11 collaboratory session. 




## Week 5 - Locate and Describe Data and Review ##

*Please post results of your data review to the the Learn Discussion area prior to the 3/11 Tuesday Collaboratory session*

Find and review three datasets that are of interest to you and/or relevant to your research. For each of the three datasets provide a 1-page evaluation that addresses the following:

Summary
:	A summary description of the dataset, it's content and structure/format. 

Documentation
:	The completeness of the available documentation that is available for the dataset - particularly focusing on the information that the documentation provides that contributes to the dataset's *usability* and *understanding*

Usability
:	How usable is the dataset to you? Can you make sense of it? Is it in a format that you can use? 

Relevance
:	The relevance of the dataset in the context of your research interests/study domain. 

You will be asked to provide a brief (10 minute) summary of what you found as a result of your data review during the required 3/11 collaboratory session. 




## Week 13 - Create a Data Management Plan ##
